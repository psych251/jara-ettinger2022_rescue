## Introduction

I chose to try and rescue the replication of this experiment because I am interested in the intersection of language and spatial/object reasoning. As a developmental cognitive scientist, I also found the comparison of adults and children to be an important element relevant to my research interests. Finally, the cross-cultural comparisons made in this paper are something that I'd like to explore further in my own research, outside of the context of this project. 

The stimuli that will be required to collect additional data for this experiment are available in the repository of the original replication project. The original replication collected data online from 144 U.S. adults, following the paradigm of Experiment 5 in the paper. It won't be possible to collect additional data from Tsimane' adults, so a replication of Experiments 6 and 7 cannot be performed. The new replication attempt will feature attention checks and a more detailed questionnaire about the subject's early geographic environment (e.g., urban versus rural, highly industrialized versus less industrialized), given the theoretical claims in the paper about the importance of early environmental factors on the strength of the shape bias in children. 

In the original paper, the only experiment (out of 7) where the data were collected online was Experiment 5. To test if the replication of the original paper partially depends on the setting of data collection, I also plan to collect data to replicate Experiment 1 in the original paper, where data were originally collected in person with U.S. children. One hypothesis for why the setting might matter is that subjects' interpretation of the physical properties of the exemplar may differ based on whether the exemplar is presented as a physical object or online. Thus, I plan to collect data asynchronously online with 30 children ages 3-9 years old using Lookit, following the same procedures for Experiment 1 in the original paper. Like with the adult studies, it won't be possible to collect additional data from Tsimane' children, so a replication of Experiments 2, 3, and 4 cannot be performed.

## Summary of prior replication attempt

Based on the prior write-up, describe any differences between the original and 1st replication in terms of methods, sample, sample size, and analysis. Note any potential problems such as exclusion rates, noisy data, or issues with analysis. 

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

How much power does your planned sample have for original effect? For an attenuated effect that is half the size of the original? 

(If power analysis is not possible or precise, discuss more fully how you determined a sample size that would be sufficient for rescue.)

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Controls

What attention checks, positive or negative controls, or other quality control measures are you adding so that a (positive or negative) result will be more interpretable?


### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study and 1st replication

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


## Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Results of control measures

How did people perform on any quality control checks or positive and negative controls? 

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Three-panel graph with original, 1st replication, and your replication is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

## Mini meta analysis
Combining across the original paper, 1st replication, and 2nd replication, what is the aggregate effect size? 

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
