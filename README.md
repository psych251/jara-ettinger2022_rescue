# Replication Project - Jara-Ettinger et al. 2022

This is a copy of the GitHub template used for replications projects in PSYCH 251. The project in this repository is a rescue of a replication of *The Origins of the Shape Bias: Evidence From the Tsimane'* by Jara-Ettinger et al. 2022. 

The repository contains the replication project template as well as a file called `anonymize.py` that you can run to remove personally-identifiable information from the data exported by Qualtrics. Just run `python anonymize.py` to anonymize all Qualtrics `csv` files in the `data` directory.
